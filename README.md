Rust is a modern programming language designed for performance and safety, particularly safe concurrency. Here are some key features:

- **Performance**: Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime or garbage collector, making it suitable for performance-critical services and embedded devices¹.
- **Safety**: Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety and prevents data races, which are common issues in other languages like C and C++².
- **Concurrency**: Rust makes it easier to write concurrent programs, thanks to its ownership and type system³.
- **Productivity**: Rust has excellent documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling, including an integrated package manager and build tool¹.

Rust is used in various domains, from web development with WebAssembly to systems programming and embedded devices. Companies like Mozilla, Dropbox, and Cloudflare use Rust in production¹².
